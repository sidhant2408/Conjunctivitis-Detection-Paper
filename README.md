<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
One of the prevalent and contagious eye conditions that affect the conjunctiva of the human eye is Conjunctivitis. Eye drops and other medications can be used to treat both the bacterial and viral forms of it. The condition must be identified at an early stage in order to understand how it is related to other illnesses, including SARS-CoV-2. One such alternative that works well for the initial screening of Conjunctivitis is any mobile application. A strong deep-learning model is needed to do this task successfully. In this study, following a comparison with seven other deep learning models, the best model is chosen for the mobile application for functioning. A comparative analysis of all the selected models is also presented here. The study reports the commendable performance of the best model with 98.4% accuracy for binary classification. <br>
